A -> B
e.g.
  "x and y are same file" -> "file size of x and y are same"

  contraposition
  "file size of x and y are not same" -> "x and y are not same file"
  not B -> not A

  using contraposition, it is used to skip file comparison
  B (here, checking file size) should be light enough than comparing file content
